Smoothieboard Change Log

Smoothieboard v1.1 (2016/10)
 - upgraded stepper drivers to A5984 drivers with 32x microstepping
 - added a solder jumper (JP36) for MS3 on new A5984 drivers
 - changed the current limiting resistors (R78,R65-R68,R84-R85) for VBB powered LEDs to 8.2K
 - added an electrolytic capacitor (C84) to the 5V power system
 - moved the electrolytic capicitor (C63) for the 5x mosfet set and increased its footprint size
 - added flyback diodes (D7-D9) to small mosfet outputs to protect from inductive loads like small fans
 - added Open Source Hardware logo with UID (FR000001)

Smoothieboard v1.0b (2015/04)
 - reworked silkscreen adding reference ids back in
 - moved VBB jumper for small mosfet pair to increase room around C63
 - corrected the polarity of the zener diode in the VBB reverse polarity protection circuit
 - moved 5v reg backflow protection diode from the 5V side to the VBB side of the vreg
 - broke out AVCC and AGND to header
 - added solder jumper to TH4 passives

Smoothieboard v1.0a (2015/01)
 - update by Mark Cooper (Logxen)
 - reworked silkscreen with more pin numbers and without reference ids
 - added GND pin to the RST/ISP header
 - modified sdcard SPI1 header to match the pinout of the SPI0 header

Smoothieboard v1.0 (2014/09)
 - update by Mark Cooper (Logxen) and Michael Moon (Triffid_Hunter)
 - fixed missing connection between GND and AGND in KS layout
 - improved silkscreen
 - other small changes

Smoothieboard KS (2013/10)
 - expansion of the Beta design to a 5 driver layout by Michael Moon (Triffid_Hunter) and Mark Cooper (Logxen)
 - added "mixed" mosfet pair of one large and one small fet
 - improved VBB reverse polarity protection circuit
 - added esd protection to endstop circuits
 - added footprint for optional 5v regulator
 - additional GND pins for various headers
 - other small changes
 - produced by cooperation between Uberclock, Robotseed, and the Smoothie community

Smoothieboard Beta (2013/01)
 - designed by Arthur Wolf (arthur-_) and Eric Sorenson (ravix)
 - the original Smoothieboard Beta was a 4 stepper driver design
 - first produced by TrinityLabs and later produced by Ipsofactio which eventually rebranded as Robotseed

Smoothieboard on a breadboard (circa 2011-current)
 - core design by Arthur Wolf (arthur-_)
 - original application circuits ported from RAMPS with modifications for use with 3.3V i/o
 - many community members built their own Smoothieboards on breadboards before Smoothieboards were commercially available
 - Smoothieboards on breadboards continue to be built today by people who are designing new derivative boards
